# Harry Potter Memory Game

A Harry Potter-inspired take on the classic memory game. Users will be prompted by 50 cards, from which they will have to select two. If it is a match, then those cards will count as a single point. Matching all cards to their respective pairs will end the game. Users can choose to play again.
